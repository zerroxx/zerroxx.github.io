                    In 2014 I started using Blender to create low poly scenes. Now, I mostly make models for games, but I like to combine assets from time to time to create scenes.<br>
                    The background video is used by combining assets for the WIP racing game.<br><br>

                    As game designer/developer I had to create a set of children games surrounding a theme.<br>
                    Ease of use and playability were my key concerns while desinging games. The games had to be fun, but also challenging enough to actually challenge the players.<br>
                    All games for the project where made in Javascript/Phaser.<br>

                    Instead of creating full fledge games, I like to test small ideas, see if it works, so I can reuse it later on.<br>
                    This project was slightly inspired by an old tv-show called 'Oban Star Racers', I like the flowiness of the vehicles, and wanted to recreate this with an AI that could work on random and procedural generated roads.

                    Over the past few years I have been designing and developing a racing game in my spare time. <br>
                    I combined my passion for history and racing games into designing a concept set in the 1930s. Aside from the lack of games set in this era, especially car games, I find this era to be fascinating. Car models started to form the shape we know them as today, and the combustion engine we know today, came into flourish in this era.<br>
                    There was a lot of racing, arguably the birth of nascar happened in the 30's, yet this era is under explored when it comes to games.<br> <br>
                    The game is set to be a simcade racing game, with the emphasis on building and combining cars, and giving the player freedom to build and race with whatever he pleases.
